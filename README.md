# Agile Policy References

I sometimes run across legal, regulatory or policy writings that would prove
helpful in pursuing modern software development within the Navy and DoD, but
it’s not always easy to just point people to the giant PDFs that typically
contain these nuggets.

So I setup this small repository and will try to add to it over time.

## Use of Agile Best Practices

### NDAA FY18

The [FY2018
NDAA](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr2810/BILLS-115hr2810enr.pdf)
included a provision (Section 874) that required between 4-8 software
development programs in DoD to be piloted for development using not just
“Agile”, but utilizing actual “Agile best practices”. Presumably to prevent
project managers or contract officers from simply declaring their preferred
method was an agile method, the law forbade seven practices from being used for
this pilot.

These seven were:

1. Use of Earned Value Management (EVM) or any EVM-like reporting construct.
    *Note*: The Defense Innovation Board has proposed measures for reporting on
    software project cost for agile projects. See Appendix C of the DIB’s [SWAP
    Report Supporting Information
    (PDF)](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Mar/26/2002105908/-1/-1/0/SWAP.REPORT_SUPPLEMENTARY.DOCS.3.21.19.PDF))
2. Development of an [integrated master schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_master_plan)
3. Development of an integrated master plan (see above)
4. Development of [technical requirement document](http://acqnotes.com/acqnote/tasks/technical-requirements-document-trd)
5. Development of [systems requirements documents](http://acqnotes.com/acqnote/careerfields/system-requirements-document)
6. Use of [information technology infrastructure library (ITIL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL) agreements.
7. Use of a software development life cycle methology.

This is a pilot, and Congress may decide to maintain some or all of these
requirements for DoD software projects going forward after the conclusion of
the pilot. However it would be prudent to assume that if you see these in
*your* software project, that you look carefully for signs of creeping
waterfall leaching into your development effort.
